iLBC or internet low bitrate codec. This is a swc that wraps the base functionality of the iLBC codec as extraced from rfc3951. Royalty free and part of the new webrtc project.
More info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Low_Bit_Rate_Codec

ilbc encode input and decode output:
pcm 16 bit signed, little-Endian, 8 khz

Flash Microphone audio:
pcm 32 bit float, Big-Endian,  mic.rate khz (http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/media/Microphone.html). This means that to use this with flash audio you will need to set mic.rate=8 and convert from float to short.

To compile .swc:
Install Adobe Alchemy http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/
# cd lib/ilbc
# alc-on
# make swc

Example usage of bin/iLBC.swc at src/org/ilbc/codec/ILBCCodec.as
